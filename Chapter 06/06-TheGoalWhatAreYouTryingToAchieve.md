---

### 1. **Introduction: What Is a Goal in a Game?**
   - Define what a goal is in the context of games: an objective or target that players are trying to reach.
   - Explain how goals provide structure and purpose, giving players something to work toward, whether it’s completing a level, winning a match, or solving a puzzle.

### 2. **Why Games Need Goals**
   - Discuss how goals give players a clear sense of direction and keep them engaged by giving them something to aim for.
   - Explain that without goals, games can feel aimless or less rewarding because players don’t know what they’re trying to achieve.

### 3. **Types of Goals: Short-Term vs. Long-Term**
   - Introduce the idea that games often have both short-term and long-term goals:
     - **Short-term goals** might be collecting an item, solving a puzzle, or defeating an enemy.
     - **Long-term goals** could be completing the game, reaching the final boss, or achieving the highest score.
   - Use examples from games like *Mario* (short-term: getting to the flag, long-term: defeating Bowser) or *Pokémon* (short-term: catching a Pokémon, long-term: becoming the champion).

### 4. **Winning the Game: The Ultimate Goal**
   - Explain that in many games, the ultimate goal is to win—whether by defeating opponents, reaching the final stage, or achieving the highest score.
   - Provide examples of games where the primary goal is to win, like board games (*Monopoly*, *Chess*) or competitive video games (*Fortnite*, *Mario Kart*).

### 5. **Level-Based Goals: Completing Each Stage**
   - Discuss how many games are divided into levels or stages, where the goal is to complete each one in order to progress.
   - Use examples from platformers like *Super Mario Bros.* or puzzle games like *Angry Birds*, where players aim to finish each level to unlock the next one.

### 6. **Scoring Points: The Goal of High Scores**
   - Talk about how some games are based on earning points, with the goal being to achieve the highest possible score.
   - Use examples from arcade-style games like *Pac-Man* or *Tetris*, where players aim to keep playing and scoring higher each time.

### 7. **Collecting Items or Achievements**
   - Explain how some games have goals centered around collecting items, power-ups, or completing specific achievements.
   - Use examples from games like *Pokémon* (catching all the Pokémon), *Super Mario Odyssey* (collecting Power Moons), or mobile games with achievements or badges.

### 8. **Time-Based Goals: Racing Against the Clock**
   - Discuss how time limits in some games add urgency and excitement by forcing players to complete a task within a certain time.
   - Use examples from racing games like *Mario Kart* (finishing first) or timed challenges in platformers (completing levels before time runs out).

### 9. **Survival Goals: Staying Alive**
   - Explain that in some games, the goal is simply to survive as long as possible, whether against enemies, environmental hazards, or other players.
   - Provide examples from survival games like *Minecraft* (staying alive and gathering resources), *Fortnite* (being the last player standing), or roguelike games.

### 10. **Exploration Goals: Discovering New Areas**
   - Talk about how some games set goals around exploration, encouraging players to find hidden areas, unlock new levels, or discover secret treasures.
   - Use examples from adventure games like *The Legend of Zelda* or sandbox games like *Minecraft*, where the goal might be to uncover new lands or complete side quests.

### 11. **Puzzle-Solving Goals: Figuring Out the Solution**
   - Discuss how puzzle games have goals focused on solving problems, whether it’s aligning pieces, unlocking doors, or completing a sequence.
   - Use examples from games like *Portal*, *Tetris*, or escape room-style games, where solving each puzzle is the primary objective.

### 12. **Team Goals: Working Together to Win**
   - Explain how in multiplayer or cooperative games, the goal may involve working as a team to achieve victory, complete a mission, or defeat a boss.
   - Provide examples from team-based games like *Overcooked* (cooking together to serve food) or sports games like *Rocket League* (scoring goals with a team).

### 13. **Strategic Goals: Planning Ahead for Victory**
   - Talk about how some games require players to set strategic goals, planning their moves ahead of time to outwit opponents or manage resources.
   - Use examples from strategy games like *Chess* (planning moves to checkmate the opponent) or resource management games like *Civilization*, where players have to think several steps ahead.

### 14. **Personal Goals: Setting Your Own Objectives**
   - Discuss how some games allow players to set their own goals, such as creating custom challenges, completing optional side quests, or achieving a personal high score.
   - Use examples from sandbox games like *Minecraft*, where players might set a goal to build a massive structure, or *The Sims*, where players create their own life goals.

### 15. **Evolving Goals: How Goals Change Over Time**
   - Explain that in many games, goals can evolve as players progress—what starts as a simple goal (e.g., finding a key) may become more complex (e.g., defeating a boss or unlocking new areas).
   - Use examples from RPGs like *Zelda* or *Pokémon*, where the goals expand as the story unfolds and players unlock new abilities.

### 16. **Side Quests: Optional Goals for Extra Rewards**

   - Use examples from *Minecraft*, *The Sims*, or *Roblox*, where the goal might be to build a beautiful house, a complex world, or an interesting level.

### 18. **Progression Goals: Earning New Skills or Levels**
   - Talk about how progression goals involve leveling up, gaining new abilities, or improving the player’s character over time.
   - Use examples from RPGs like *Pokémon* (leveling up Pokémon to become stronger) or *Zelda* (gaining new items or abilities that help complete tougher challenges).

### 19. **Replayability: Achieving Different Goals on Each Playthrough**
   - Explain that some games encourage replayability by offering different goals or outcomes depending on the choices players make.
   - Use examples from games with multiple endings (*Undertale*) or branching storylines (*Detroit: Become Human*), where players can set new goals for each playthrough.

### 20. **Final Thoughts: How Goals Keep Us Playing**
