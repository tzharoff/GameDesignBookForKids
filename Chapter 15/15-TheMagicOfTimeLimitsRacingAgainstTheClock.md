### 10. **Time Limits in Boss Fights: Adding Pressure to Key Moments**
   - Explore how some games use time limits during boss fights, making the battle more intense by giving players limited time to defeat a powerful enemy.
   - Use examples from games like *The Legend of Zelda: Majora’s Mask* (where the entire game world is on a countdown) or *Resident Evil* (timed escape sequences).
   - Discuss how time-limited boss fights force players to manage both time and strategy, adding complexity to the challenge.

### 11. **Turn-Based Games: Managing Time in Strategy**
   - Explain how turn-based games often introduce time limits per turn to keep the game moving and prevent players from spending too long thinking.
   - Use examples from games like *Speed Chess* (time limits per move) or *Civilization* (multiplayer games with turn timers).
   - Discuss how adding a time element to turn-based games forces players to make quicker decisions and adapt on the fly.

### 12. **Penalty for Running Out of Time: What Happens?**
   - Talk about the consequences of running out of time in games, whether it’s losing points, starting over, or failing a mission.
   - Use examples from games like *Mario Kart* (not finishing the race in time) or *Candy Crush* (failing a level when the time runs out).
   - Discuss how penalties for running out of time motivate players to stay focused and act quickly.

### 13. **Bonus Time: Rewarding Players with Extra Time**
   - Explain how some games reward players with extra time for completing certain objectives, giving them more opportunities to succeed.
