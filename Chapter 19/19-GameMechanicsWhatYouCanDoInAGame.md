19. **"Game Mechanics: What You Can Do in a Game"**
    - Break down game mechanics (the actions players can take), like jumping, running, collecting, or building, and how they define what a game is about.

---

### 1. **Introduction: What Are Game Mechanics?**
   - Define game mechanics as the rules and systems that allow players to interact with the game world and achieve goals.
   - Explain that mechanics dictate what players can do in a game, from movement to interacting with objects, and are key to defining the gameplay experience.

### 2. **Core Game Mechanics: The Basic Actions Players Can Take**
   - Explore the basic actions that players perform repeatedly in many games, such as:
     - **Running and walking** (movement across the game world).
     - **Jumping** (moving vertically to avoid obstacles or reach higher places).
     - **Attacking or shooting** (fighting enemies or destroying objects).
     - **Collecting items** (gathering resources or objects to complete tasks).
   - Use examples from games like *Super Mario* (jumping, running, collecting coins) or *Minecraft* (mining, building, crafting).

### 3. **Movement Mechanics: How Players Navigate the Game World**
   - Explain how movement is a fundamental mechanic in most games, determining how players navigate the game world.
   - Use examples from platformers like *Celeste* (jumping, climbing, dashing) or open-world games like *Breath of the Wild* (running, climbing, gliding).
   - Discuss how movement mechanics can vary widely based on the genre of the game and how they impact exploration and challenge.

### 4. **Combat Mechanics: Fighting and Defeating Enemies**
   - Discuss combat mechanics, which include actions like attacking, dodging, blocking, or using special abilities to defeat enemies.
   - Use examples from action games like *Fortnite* (shooting, building) or *Zelda* (sword combat, shield blocking).

   - Use examples from games like *Portal* (solving physics-based puzzles with portals) or *The Witness* (using environmental clues to solve puzzles).
   - Discuss how puzzle mechanics challenge players to think critically and often require creativity to progress.

### 6. **Collection Mechanics: Gathering Items and Resources**
   - Explore collection mechanics, where players gather items, resources, or power-ups that are important for completing objectives.
   - Use examples from games like *Super Mario* (collecting coins and power-ups) or *Pokémon* (catching and collecting Pokémon).
   - Explain how collection mechanics often provide rewards and encourage exploration.

### 7. **Building and Crafting Mechanics: Creating and Shaping the World**
   - Discuss building and crafting mechanics, which allow players to create structures, tools, or other items to shape the game world.
   - Use examples from games like *Minecraft* (building and crafting) or *Fortnite* (building defenses during combat).
   - Explain how these mechanics give players more control over the environment and encourage creativity.

### 8. **Exploration Mechanics: Discovering New Areas and Secrets**
   - Talk about exploration mechanics, where players are encouraged to discover new areas, hidden items, or secret paths in the game world.
   - Use examples from open-world games like *Breath of the Wild* (exploring an open map) or *Hollow Knight* (finding hidden rooms and collectibles).
   - Discuss how exploration mechanics reward curiosity and create a sense of adventure.

### 9. **Stealth Mechanics: Avoiding Detection**
   - Introduce stealth mechanics, where players must avoid being detected by enemies or traps to progress.
   - Use examples from games like *Metal Gear Solid* (hiding from enemies) or *Assassin’s Creed* (blending in with crowds).
   - Explain how stealth mechanics add tension and strategy, requiring players to think carefully about timing and movement.

### 10. **Dialogue and Choice Mechanics: Making Decisions in the Story**
   - Explore dialogue and choice mechanics, where players can interact with characters and make decisions that impact the story.
   - Use examples from games like *Mass Effect* (choosing dialogue options that affect relationships and outcomes) or *Undertale* (choosing to fight or befriend enemies).
   - Discuss how these mechanics give players more control over the narrative and create a more personalized experience.

### 11. **Resource Management Mechanics: Balancing Limited Resources**
   - Talk about resource management mechanics, where players must collect and manage resources (like health, money, or materials) to progress in the game.
   - Use examples from survival games like *Don’t Starve* (managing food and health) or strategy games like *Civilization* (managing resources to build cities).
   - Explain how these mechanics challenge players to plan carefully and make strategic decisions about how to use their resources.

### 12. **Platforming Mechanics: Jumping, Climbing, and Navigating Obstacles**
   - Discuss platforming mechanics, where players must jump, climb, and navigate through challenging environments.
   - Use examples from games like *Super Mario* (jumping over gaps and onto platforms) or *Celeste* (tight platforming controls and wall climbing).
   - Explain how platforming mechanics test a player’s reflexes, timing, and precision.

### 13. **Time-Based Mechanics: Racing Against the Clock**
   - Explore time-based mechanics, where players must complete tasks within a certain time limit or race against the clock.
   - Use examples from games like *Mario Kart* (racing against other players) or *Overcooked* (completing cooking tasks under time pressure).
   - Discuss how time-based mechanics create urgency and excitement, requiring players to make quick decisions.

### 14. **Inventory and Equipment Mechanics: Managing Tools and Items**
   - Talk about inventory mechanics, where players must manage the items and equipment they collect during the game.
   - Use examples from role-playing games (RPGs) like *Zelda* (managing weapons, tools, and potions) or *Pokémon* (managing Pokéballs, potions, and held items).
   - Explain how inventory mechanics add a layer of strategy, requiring players to choose the right tools for different situations.

### 15. **Progression Mechanics: Leveling Up and Gaining Abilities**
   - Introduce progression mechanics, where players earn experience points (XP), level up, or unlock new abilities as they progress through the game.
   - Use examples from games like *Pokémon* (leveling up Pokémon) or *Zelda* (gaining new items and powers).
   - Explain how progression mechanics give players a sense of growth and reward their efforts by making their character stronger or more skilled.

### 16. **Health and Survival Mechanics: Staying Alive in the Game**

   - Use examples from games like *Minecraft* (monitoring health and hunger) or *Dark Souls* (managing health while facing difficult enemies).
   - Discuss how these mechanics create tension and encourage careful planning, as players must avoid damage and find ways to heal or protect themselves.

### 17. **Physics-Based Mechanics: Using Real-World Rules in the Game**
   - Talk about physics-based mechanics, where players interact with the game world using real-world physics, such as gravity, momentum, and force.
   - Use examples from games like *Angry Birds* (calculating trajectory and force to destroy structures) or *Portal* (using momentum to solve puzzles).
   - Explain how physics-based mechanics add realism and complexity to gameplay, challenging players to think critically about how objects will behave.

### 18. **Multiplayer Mechanics: Playing with or Against Other Players**
   - Discuss multiplayer mechanics, where players interact with others, either working together in cooperative play or competing against each other.
