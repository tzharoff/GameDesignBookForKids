### 2. **The Purpose of Games**

#### Why Do Games Have Goals?
Games are all about **goals**—objectives that players work toward during play. Whether it’s winning, solving a problem, or reaching a specific target, having a goal gives structure to a game and makes it more engaging. Without a goal, there would be no direction or purpose, and the experience wouldn’t be as thrilling or satisfying.

- In *Super Mario*, the goal is clear: make it to the end of the level to rescue Princess Peach.
- In *Monopoly*, your goal is to buy properties and accumulate the most wealth.
- Even simple games like tag have goals, such as avoiding being tagged or trying to tag someone else. 

Without goals, games wouldn’t be as fun because players wouldn’t have anything to strive for, making the experience feel aimless.

#### Different Types of Goals in Games
There are many different kinds of goals in games, each making the experience unique:

- **Winning**: In many games, the goal is to be the best and win. In races, for instance, the objective is to be the fastest and cross the finish line first.
- **Solving Puzzles**: In puzzle-based games like *Tetris*, the goal isn’t about beating others but solving problems, such as arranging blocks to clear lines.
- **Reaching a Destination**: In games like *Super Mario* or *Candy Land*, the goal is to reach a particular location or finish line.
- **Building Something**: Games like *Minecraft* let players set their own goals, like creating structures or designing entire worlds.
- **Exploring**: Some games focus on adventure and exploration, like *Zelda: Breath of the Wild*, where the goal is to discover new areas and complete quests.

#### How Goals Make Games Fun
- **Challenges You**: Goals make a game challenging, requiring players to strategize, solve problems, or act quickly. This makes the experience more rewarding.
- **Creates Excitement**: The anticipation of reaching a goal creates excitement, whether it’s crossing a finish line or solving a difficult puzzle.
- **Motivates You to Keep Playing**: A clear goal encourages persistence, even if the player doesn’t succeed on the first try. You want to keep trying until you achieve your goal.
- **Provides a Sense of Accomplishment**: Achieving a game’s goal brings satisfaction and pride, especially after overcoming obstacles along the way.

#### Examples of Game Goals
- **Tag**: Avoid being tagged or try to tag others.
- **Super Mario**: Complete each level by reaching the flag at the end.
- **Pokémon**: Catch as many Pokémon as possible and win battles.
- **Minecraft**: Players can set their own goals, such as building, exploring, or defeating the Ender Dragon.

#### Why Having Goals Makes You a Better Player
Working toward a game’s goal helps develop important skills such as:
- **Problem-Solving**: You must figure out the best strategies to achieve your goal.
- **Planning**: Many games require players to think ahead and plan their actions.
- **Perseverance**: Sometimes, you won’t achieve your goal right away, but the desire to succeed drives you to keep trying.

Every time you play a game with a goal, you improve your ability to think critically, solve problems, and stay determined.

#### What Happens If There’s No Goal?
Imagine playing tag without anyone being "it"—there wouldn’t be any chase, no excitement, and the game would feel empty. Goals give games **direction** and **excitement**. Without them, players would lose interest because there wouldn’t be any challenges to overcome or achievements to strive for.

That’s why game designers always think carefully about goals, making sure they give players something fun and exciting to work toward!
