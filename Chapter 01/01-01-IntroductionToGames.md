**What Is a Game?**

A game is an activity that people engage in for enjoyment, excitement, or to challenge themselves. At its core, a game has rules, participants, and goals. These can vary widely: some games are played solo, while others require multiple players or even large groups. Games can take place indoors, outdoors, on screens, or involve physical objects such as toys and tools. 

The purpose of most games is to entertain, and many games include a way to "win." However, not all games focus on competition; some are about the experience, learning something new, or simply having fun.

### Types of Games

- **Tag**: A classic outdoor game where one player, known as "it," tries to chase and tag others. The goal for the other players is to avoid being tagged.
  
- **Video Games**: Played on a screen, video games require players to use a controller or keyboard to navigate virtual characters or worlds. Popular examples include *Minecraft*, *Super Mario*, and *Roblox*.

- **Board Games**: Played on a physical board, these games often involve moving pieces according to dice rolls or card draws. Popular examples include *Monopoly*, *Candy Land*, and *Sorry!*

- **Puzzle Games**: Games that challenge the mind, often involving solving problems or arranging pieces to fit in a specific way. Examples include jigsaw puzzles and video games like *Tetris*.

- **Sports Games**: Physical games that involve using the body or equipment to achieve a goal, such as soccer, basketball, or tennis.

### Why Do We Play Games?

- **To Have Fun**: The main reason people play games is to enjoy themselves. Whether it's a simple game of tag or an intense video game, the focus is on entertainment.
  
- **To Learn New Things**: Games can be educational, teaching skills like problem-solving, strategy, or teamwork.

- **To Challenge Yourself**: Some games test your abilities, pushing you to think critically, move quickly, or improve skills like hand-eye coordination.

- **To Compete**: Many games involve competition, where players strive to win, making the experience more engaging.

While each game has its own rules, the overarching goal is always the same—having fun!
