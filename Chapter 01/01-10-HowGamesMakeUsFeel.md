### 10. **How Games Make Us Feel**

#### Games Create All Kinds of Emotions
One of the coolest things about games is how they make us **feel**. Whether you’re playing a video game, a board game, or a sport, games can bring out a lot of different emotions—like excitement, joy, frustration, and even pride. That’s because games are designed to challenge us, surprise us, and reward us for doing our best.

When we play games, we experience these emotions because we’re **actively involved**—we’re solving problems, working with teammates, or trying to win. Games aren’t just about what happens on the screen or on the field—they’re about how they make us feel while we’re playing!

#### The Excitement of Playing
Have you ever felt your heart race while playing a game? Maybe you were trying to defeat a difficult level in a video game, score the winning goal in soccer, or make the right move in a board game to win. That feeling is called **excitement**! It’s one of the best parts of playing games.

Games create excitement by:
- **Building suspense**: When you’re close to winning or about to overcome a big challenge, you feel a rush of energy.
- **Surprises**: Many games have surprises, like getting a power-up in *Mario Kart* or drawing an unexpected card in *Uno*. These surprises keep you on your toes and make the game even more thrilling.
- **Competition**: When you’re competing against others, whether it’s friends, family, or even yourself, it makes the game more exciting as you try to win or beat your previous score.

That excitement is what keeps you coming back to play again and again!

#### The Joy of Having Fun
The main reason we play games is to have **fun**! Games make us feel **joyful** because they let us do things we enjoy—whether it’s running around with friends in a game of tag or solving puzzles in a video game.

Here’s why games bring us joy:
- **Freedom to be creative**: Many games let you use your imagination, like building your own world in *Minecraft* or making up stories with toys and friends.
- **Sharing laughs with others**: Games often make us laugh, especially when we’re playing with friends or family. Whether it’s a funny moment in a game or just being silly, having fun together is one of the best feelings.
- **Feeling proud of your achievements**: When you complete a tough level, win a game, or reach a new goal, you feel a sense of accomplishment that makes you happy. You worked hard and succeeded—what’s not to love about that?

Games are designed to be fun because they give us **freedom**, **creativity**, and a chance to share happy moments with others.

#### The Frustration of Challenges
Of course, not all games are easy, and sometimes that’s when we feel **frustration**. Maybe you’re stuck on a tricky level, or you keep losing in a game against your friends. It’s normal to feel frustrated when things don’t go the way you want—but that frustration is also what makes games so rewarding.

Here’s why games can make you feel frustrated:
- **Difficult challenges**: Some games are hard, and when you don’t succeed right away, it can feel annoying or even upsetting. But those tough challenges also make winning feel even better!
- **Learning from mistakes**: In games, you might lose a few times before figuring out how to win. It can be frustrating to keep trying, but each time you learn something new that helps you improve.
- **Competition**: Losing a game can be frustrating, especially if you really wanted to win. But games teach us that it’s okay to lose sometimes because we can always try again and get better.

Frustration isn’t a bad thing—it’s a sign that you’re **pushing yourself** to improve, and that’s how you grow as a player!

#### The Desire to Improve
One of the most amazing feelings that games give us is the **desire to improve**. When you don’t win or complete a level on the first try, it doesn’t mean you should give up. Instead, you feel inspired to try again and do even better. That’s called **determination**, and it’s one of the best things about playing games.

Games help you improve by:
- **Challenging your skills**: Whether it’s thinking ahead in chess, practicing your aim in basketball, or learning new strategies in a video game, games always give you a chance to improve.
- **Encouraging practice**: The more you play, the better you get. Each time you practice, you get a little closer to winning or reaching your goal.
- **Making progress feel good**: Games are designed to reward you for making progress. Even if you don’t win right away, small achievements—like getting to the next level or mastering a new move—make you feel proud of yourself.

The desire to improve is what keeps games exciting, because there’s always something new to learn or achieve. And the more you play, the better you get!

#### The Satisfaction of Winning
Winning a game gives you a feeling of **satisfaction**. When you work hard and finally reach your goal, whether it’s beating a high score, winning a match, or solving a puzzle, you feel proud and happy. That sense of accomplishment is one of the best rewards that games offer.

Here’s why winning feels so satisfying:
- **You earned it**: Winning means you used your skills, practiced, and put in the effort. It’s a reward for everything you’ve worked for.
- **It boosts your confidence**: Winning helps you believe in yourself. It shows you that with hard work, you can achieve great things.
- **You can share the victory**: Winning isn’t just fun for you—it’s fun for your teammates too! In cooperative games, winning together makes everyone feel proud and happy.

But remember, while winning feels great, it’s not the only reason we play games. **Having fun**, **learning new things**, and **spending time with others** are all part of what makes playing games so enjoyable.

#### Why Games Are Designed to Make Us Feel
Games are special because they’re designed to **make us feel something**. Whether it’s the joy of playing, the excitement of a close match, or the frustration of a tough challenge, games are created to give us emotional experiences that we remember long after the game is over.

Here’s how games are designed to make us feel:
- **Fun and entertainment**: Most games are made to entertain us and give us fun moments, like laughing with friends or celebrating a win.
