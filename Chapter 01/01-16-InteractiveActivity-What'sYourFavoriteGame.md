### 16. **Interactive Activity: What’s Your Favorite Game?**

Now that we’ve talked about all the different types of games and how fun they can be, it’s time for **you** to think about your favorite game! This activity will help you think about what makes your favorite game so much fun and why you love playing it. Whether it’s a video game, a board game, a sport, or a playground game, every game has something special that makes it enjoyable.

Let’s get started with some fun questions to help you describe your favorite game!

#### Step 1: Name Your Favorite Game
First, think about your **favorite game**. It could be anything—maybe a video game like *Minecraft*, a board game like *Monopoly*, a sport like soccer, or even a fun playground game like *Tag*. Write down or think about the name of the game you love the most.

- What is your favorite game called?
  
#### Step 2: Describe the Goal of the Game
Every game has a **goal**, something you’re trying to achieve when you play. The goal might be to win, solve a puzzle, score points, or complete a level. Think about the goal of your favorite game and what you’re trying to do when you play.

- What is the main goal of your favorite game? (For example, “In *Super Mario*, the goal is to complete each level and rescue Princess Peach” or “In soccer, the goal is to score more goals than the other team.”)
  
#### Step 3: Talk About the Rules
Next, think about the **rules** of your favorite game. Rules are important because they guide how the game is played and make it fair for everyone. Some games have lots of rules, while others are simple. Either way, the rules make the game more fun and challenging!

- What are some of the most important rules in your favorite game? (For example, “In *Monopoly*, you have to roll the dice and move your token around the board” or “In *Minecraft*, you have to gather resources to survive in survival mode.”)
  
#### Step 4: What Makes It Fun?
Now, think about what makes your favorite game so much fun to play! Is it the adventure? The challenge? The chance to play with friends? Maybe it’s the excitement of competition or the creativity you get to use. Every game has something special that keeps you coming back for more.

- What do you love most about your favorite game? (For example, “I love *Mario Kart* because it’s fast and exciting” or “I love *Minecraft* because I can build anything I want.”)

#### Step 5: Who Do You Play With?
Some games are fun to play by yourself, while others are more fun with friends or family. Think about who you usually play your favorite game with.

- Do you play your favorite game by yourself, with friends, or with family? (For example, “I play *Fortnite* with my friends online” or “I play *Candy Land* with my little sister.”)

#### Step 6: Draw a Picture of Your Favorite Game!
Now that you’ve thought about what makes your favorite game fun, try drawing a picture of you playing it! You can draw your character from a video game, you and your friends playing a board game, or even you running around the soccer field. Use your imagination and creativity to bring your favorite game to life!

#### Example of How to Describe Your Favorite Game
Here’s an example of what your answers might look like:

- **Favorite Game**: *Super Mario*
- **Goal**: The goal is to travel through different levels, avoid enemies, and reach the flag at the end to save Princess Peach.
- **Rules**: You can jump on enemies to defeat them, collect coins for points, and use power-ups like mushrooms to grow or fire flowers to shoot fireballs.
- **What Makes It Fun**: I love *Super Mario* because every level is different, and it’s fun to explore new worlds and try to beat each one.
